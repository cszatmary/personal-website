                Hi I&apos;m Chris, a software developer with a passion for automation. I love
                building tools to automate common tasks and solve interesting problems. I studied
                Computer Science at Ryerson University and minored in Mathematics. My favourite area
                of mathematics is Graph Theory.

              <p className="px-3">
                I also enjoy playing pinball (physical tables not digital) and watching hockey. I
                cheer for the Toronto Maple Leafs for better or for worse.

        <h2 className="my-2">What I do</h2>
        <p>
          I have experience with a lot of languages, libraries, and tools. Here are the main ones I
          currently use:
        </p>
        <Row className="my-3">{skills}</Row>
        <p>I primarily enjoy the roles of developer acceleration and production engineering.</p>
      </Container>
      <Container className="py-3">
        <h2 className="my-2">What even is Developer Acceleration?</h2>
        <p>
          Developer Acceleration is all about making it easy as possible for developers to deliver
          value to customers. I build tools to make local development as easy and painless as
          possible. I also set up CI/CD processes to make it easy and safe to ship code to
          production and roll it back when something goes wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve always enjoyed the area of developer efficiency and Developer Acceleration has
          been a perfect fit for me. Any time I find something tedious that I constantly have to do
          that slows me down, or I find something that is way harder than it should be, I find a way
          to automate it.
